# UFOs
Module 11
## Overview
This project utilized the following resources:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap

These resources were used to build a webpage that is integrated with a dataset. The data is presented in a table that takes users input and filters the dataset based on the inputs. All data is related to UFOs. 

## Results

App is deployed at following address: https://chalmersmjason.github.io/UFOs/

This webpage can be used by entering criteria in the search bars. The full dataset by default can be seen on the page:

A user can use the full dataset to see what to filter. Once a value is entered, the dataset will automatically update, as seen below:

The date is filtered to 1/1/2010, the country is filtered to 'us', & the state is filtered to 'ca'. As you can see in the data, all the filters were automatically applied. 

## Summary

The drawback of this design is that users may not know all the values that are available to filter on. I suggest adding recommendations for the users as well as adding totals for each value to allow the users to have a better understanding of what the data actually means.
